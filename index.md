## CoMeta: A Corpus for Metaphor Detection in Spanish

We present CoMeta, a manually annotated Corpus for Metaphor Detection in Spanish with the aim of facilitating research on automatic metaphor detection. We believe that CoMeta is the largest publicly available dataset with metaphorical annotations in texts of general domain for the Spanish language.



### CoMeta Description 

The annotation of CoMeta has been inspired by the MIPVU guidelines used to develop
the most popular metaphor corpus for English namely, the VUA corpus. 

### Datasets

The dataset is publicly available: [Download Cometa Dataset](https://github.com/ixa-ehu/cometa/blob/main/dataset.zip)

### Metaphor Detection Results

We leverage CoMeta to fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa. We believe that the close performance achieved in comparison to the results obtained with the
larger English VUA dataset are quite promising and encouraging for future researchers interested in using CoMeta or in developing their own
corpora for their languages of interest.
